# Measuring Market Risk

The mmr (Measuring Market Risk) package ports the Matlab code associated with Kevin Dowd's Measuring Market Risk (2002) to R. Dowd provides the motivation for this package in his preface via a quote:

> You are responsible for managing your company’s foreign exchange positions. Your boss, or your boss’s boss, has been reading about derivatives losses suffered by other companies, and wants to know if the same thing could happen to his company. That is, he wants to know just how much market risk the company is taking. What do you say? You could start by listing and describing the company’s positions, but this isn’t likely to be helpful unless there are only a handful. Even then, it helps only if your superiors understand all of the positions and instruments, and the risks inherent in each. Or you could talk about the portfolio’s sensitivities, i.e., how much the value of the portfolio changes when various underlying market rates or prices change, and perhaps option delta’s and gamma’s. However, you are unlikely to win favour with your superiors by putting them to sleep. Even if you are confident in your ability to explain these in English, you still have no natural way to net the risk of your short position in Deutsche marks against the long position in Dutch guilders. ... You could simply assure your superiors that you never speculate but rather use derivatives only to hedge, but they understand that this statement is vacuous. They know that the word ‘hedge’ is so ill-defined and flexible that virtually any transaction can be characterized as a hedge. So what do you say? ... Perhaps the best answer starts: ‘The value at risk is ...’”. (Linsmeier and Pearson (1996))

And to take a quote from Dowd himself:

> As always in risk measurement, we should keep our wits about us and not be too trusting of the software we use or the results we get.

So I ask users to do the same of my own work. Any issues or pull requests are welcome.
